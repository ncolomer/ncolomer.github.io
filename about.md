I am someone who have always been fascinated by computer sciences. You can see me as an experimentalist: always testing new things and learning new concepts. This is what I like.

I dedicate my spare time to Open Source development, some Electronics crazy projects, Massive Open Online Courses (mostly on Coursera) and Geomatics.
